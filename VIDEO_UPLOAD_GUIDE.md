## 🎯 Best Practices for Video Upload

### **File Size Recommendations**
```
✅ Under 50MB: Uploads quickly, good user experience
⚠️ 50MB - 100MB: Works but takes longer to upload
⚠️ 100MB - 600MB: Very large, several minutes to upload
❌ Over 600MB: Use YouTube/Vimeo instead
```

### **Video Format Recommendations**
```
🥇 MP4 (H.264): Best compatibility, smaller file sizes
🥈 WebM: Good compression, modern browsers
🥉 MOV: Apple format, larger files
⚠️ AVI: Older format, very large files
```

### **Resolution Guidelines**
```
✅ 1080p (1920x1080): Good quality, reasonable size
✅ 720p (1280x720): Smaller files, still good quality
⚠️ 4K (3840x2160): Excellent quality but huge files
```

## 📱 Video Compression Tips

### **Before Uploading**
To reduce file size without losing quality:

#### **Using HandBrake (Free)**
1. Download HandBrake (free video converter)
2. Select "Web Optimized" preset
3. Set quality to 22-24 (good balance)
4. Enable "Web Optimized" checkbox
5. Export - typically 50-70% smaller files

#### **Using Online Tools**
- **CloudConvert**: Free online video compression
- **Clipchamp**: Microsoft's free video editor
- **VEED.io**: Online video compressor

#### **Quick Settings for Small Files**
```
Resolution: 1280x720 (720p)
Bitrate: 2-4 Mbps
Format: MP4 (H.264)
Frame Rate: 30fps
Audio: 128kbps AAC
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```
For Web:
- Use MP4 format

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Upload Not Working**
1. **Check File Size**: Must be under 600MB
2. **Check Format**: Use MP4, WebM, MOV, or AVI
3. **Wait for Completion**: Large files (100MB+) can take 5-10 minutes
4. **Keep Tab Open**: Don't close or refresh during upload
5. **Check Browser**: Try different browser if issues persist

### **Video Not Saving**
1. **Confirm Green Status**: Look for ✅ "Video uploaded successfully"
2. **Save Project**: Click "Create Project" or "Update Project"
3. **Check Storage**: Browser must allow localStorage

### **Video Not Playing**  
1. **Check Format**: MP4 works best across browsers
2. **File Corruption**: Try re-uploading
3. **Browser Support**: Update to latest browser version

### **Large File Issues**
```
If file is too large:
1. Compress video using tools mentioned above
2. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo instead
3. Use external hosting service
4. Split into shorter segments
```

## 📊 File Size Calculator

### **Estimating Upload Times**
```
1MB file: ~2-5 seconds
10MB file: ~20-40 seconds
50MB file: ~2-4 minutes
100MB file: ~4-8 minutes
300MB file: ~10-15 minutes
600MB file: ~20-30 minutes
```

*Times vary based on internet speed and device performance*

### **Storage Usage**
```
Browser localStorage limit: Varies by browser (Chrome ~10MB, Firefox ~10MB)
Recommended per video: Under 50MB for best performance
Maximum allowed: 600MB (may impact browser performance)

⚠️ Important: Very large videos may slow down your browser
