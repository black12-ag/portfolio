- ‚úÖ **Longer videos**: Multi-minute demonstrations  
- ‚úÖ **Uncompressed content**: Less compression needed
- ‚úÖ **Professional quality**: Broadcast-quality demos

### **Upload Time Expectations:**
```
50MB file: ~2-4 minutes
100MB file: ~4-8 minutes  
300MB file: ~10-15 minutes
600MB file: ~20-30 minutes
```

*Times vary based on internet speed and device performance*

### **Performance Considerations**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Large videos use browser storage space
- May slow down browser if many large videos stored
- Consider YouTube/Vimeo for files over 300MB for better performance
- Keep tab open during large uploads

## üöÄ Best Practices with 600MB Limit

### **When to Use Direct Upload (up to 600MB)**
- ‚úÖ **Complete control** over video hosting
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** (works offline)
- ‚úÖ **Professional demos** up to 5-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ **High-quality showcases** of your work

### **When to Use External Hosting (YouTube/Vimeo)**
- ‚úÖ **Videos over 300MB** for better performance
- ‚úÖ **Very long demos** (10+ minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Multiple large videos** to save browser space
- ‚úÖ **Better video controls** and streaming

### **Optimization Tips**
```
For 600MB Budget:
- Use H.264 MP4 format
- 1080p resolution maximum
- 30fps frame rate  
- 8-15 Mbps bitrate for high quality
- Consider 2-pass encoding
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **What Changed in Code:**
```javascript
// Old limit
if (file.size > 50 * 1024 * 1024) { // 50MB
  // Reject file
}

// New limit  
if (file.size > 600 * 1024 * 1024) { // 600MB
  // Reject file
}

// Added progress tracking
setVideoUploadProgress(progress);
setIsVideoUploading(true);
```

### **New Features Added:**
- **Progress state management**: `videoUploadProgress`, `isVideoUploading`
- **Progress simulation**: Realistic progress bar for large files
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better error messages and recovery
- **UI improvements**: Progress bar, status indicators, disabled states

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### **Browser Storage Limitations**
- Most browsers allow 5-10MB in localStorage
- Large videos stored as base64 (increases size ~33%)
- A 600MB video becomes ~800MB in storage
- Consider your total video storage across all projects

### **Performance Impact**
- Very large videos may slow browser startup
- Multiple large videos compound the issue
- Consider clearing old videos periodically
- Monitor browser performance with large files

### **Upload Reliability**
- Keep browser tab open during upload
- Don't refresh page during large uploads
- Stable internet connection recommended
- Have fallback plan (external hosting) for critical videos

## üìà Recommended Workflow

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Start Small**: Test with 50-100MB videos first
2. **Compress Wisely**: Use tools like HandBrake for optimization
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch browser performance with large files
4. **Have Backups**: Keep original files and external hosting options
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify videos work across different devices

### **Storage Strategy:**
```
Portfolio Videos:
- 1-3 small demos per project (under 50MB each)
- 1 high-quality showcase (100-300MB)
- External hosting for longer content

Total Recommendation:
- Keep under 1GB total video storage
- Prioritize most important demos
- Use external hosting for supplementary content
```
